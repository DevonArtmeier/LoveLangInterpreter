# LoveLang Interpreter
![LoveLang Interpreter](LoveLang.png)
An interpreter for my own custom esoteric programming language called "LoveLang", where every operation and value is a heart emoji.

## How LoveLang works
You are given a set of cells to store data in, each cell being 8-bit. This interpreter has 4096 cells allocated, but I do not have a standard set, it can be whatever. You can move over a cell left or right, and if it goes out of bounds, you wrap around. There is also a temporary cell used for certain operations (i.e. add, subtract, AND, OR, XOR, compare, and bit shifting/rotation).

Numbers are used whenever being stored into the temp cell, or being used to jump to a label. A number is at max 8 bits. A number is stored as a series of black and white heart emojis in binary, with the black emoji representing a 0, and a white emoji representing a 1. It is terminated by the start of a new instruction. For example, 45 (101101) would be stored as 游밼游둯游밼游밼游둯游밼. Because numbers can also be signed (in two's complement), -1 (11111111) would be represented as 游밼游밼游밼游밼游밼游밼游밼游밼.

Jumping backwards to a nonexistent label will jump back to the start of the program. Likewise, jumping forwards to a nonexistent label will jump to the end of the program. The label offset stored in jump instructions are relative and signed, so storing 1 as the label offset will jump forward to the next label, storing 2 will jump forwards 2 labels, etc.

There are 3 conditional flags: zero, negative, and carry. Whenever a value is read/stored anywhere, the zero and negative flags are set according to the value itself. With operations involving a second value, the carry flag is also set based on if an overflow or underflow has occured. Bit rotation uses the carry flag as a 9th bit.

An input stream is also supported. Reading from the input stream reads 1 byte and stores it. If it has reached past the end of the input stream, the carry flag is set and nothing will be overwritten. Otherwise, the carry flag is cleared.

Any non-support character/emoji should be ignored and treated as a comment.

## Sample program
This sample program reads the input stream and outputs it in reverse order.

	游밽				         LABEL 1
	仇벒잺游눝				       READ FROM INPUT AND STORE IN CELL
	游눞游비游밼				     EXIT LOOP ONCE AT END OF INPUT STREAM
	游비游눜				       INCREMENT CHARACTER COUNT
	仇벒잺游비				       NEXT CELL
	游눞游밼游밼游밼游밼游밼游밼游밼游밼	   LOOP UNTIL ALL CHARACTERS ARE READ
	
	游밽				         LABEL 2
	仇벒잺仇벒잺				       MOVE 1 CELL LEFT
	仇벒잺游눛				       READ FROM CELL AND STORE IN OUTPUT STREAM
	游비游눝				       DECREMENT CHARACTER COUNT
	游눞游눜游밼游밼游밼游밼游밼游밼游밼游밼	LOOP UNTIL ALL CHARACTERS ARE STREAMED TO OUTPUT
